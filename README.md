Oracle Database Sample Schemas, 12c Release 2 (12.2) in May 2017.
The Oracle Database sample schemas are based on a fictitious sample company that sells goods through various channels. The company operates worldwide to fill orders for products. It has several divisions, each of which is represented by a sample database schema:

Schema HR – Division Human Resources tracks information about the company employees and facilities.

Schema OE – Division Order Entry tracks product inventories and sales of company products through various channels.

Schema PM – Division Product Media maintains descriptions and detailed

information about each product sold by the company.

Schema IX – Division Information Exchange manages shipping through B2B applications.

In this project We enjoyed HR schema and OE for our purpose.
